This project aims to demonstrate my understand of various sorting algorithms in computer science.
Algorithms are showcased running in real time, with variable speed.

D3.js was used to implement visualizations.

- Selection sort
- Insertion sort

### Coming soon

- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Heap sort
- Shell sort
- Tim sort
- Gnome sort
- Bitonic sort
- Pancake sort
- Bogo sort
- Exchange sort

### Tech Stack
